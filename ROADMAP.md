# ROADMAP
What things do we want to work on next? And what did we already achieve?

## Short term plans
- get feedback on whether the project template is useful so far. Reach out to interested individuals

## Mid term plans
- style project admin backend better, e.g. how does markdown work?
- display existing files and allow user to delete individual files from their accounts
- allow multiple upload fields with different meta data that'll be associated
## Long term plans
- add a simple `celery` integration that allows people to write their own validations for uploaded files

## Already done ðŸŽ‰
- make sure that `APP_BASE_URL` will be stripped of trailing `/`s
- read everything that is currently in `.env` can be read from a `_config.yml` <- **not fully fixed, but putting sensitive data into `config.yml` would suck**
- read project descriptions etc. from `markdown` files somewhere and render accordingly
- deploy to heroku works thanks to @madprime!
- styled all forms enough to be useable.
