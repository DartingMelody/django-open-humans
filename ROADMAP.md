# ToDo list
- get feedback

# feature wishlist
- display existing files and allow user to delete
- allow multiple upload fields with different meta data that'll be associated

# Done
- make sure that `APP_BASE_URL` will be stripped of trailing `/`s
- read everything that is currently in `.env` can be read from a `_config.yml` <- **not fully fixed, but putting sensitive data into `config.yml` would suck**
- read project descriptions etc. from `markdown` files somewhere and render accordingly
- deploy to heroku works thanks to @madprime!
- styled all forms enough to be useable.
