# ToDo list

- make sure that `APP_BASE_URL` will be stripped of trailing `/`s
- read everything that is currently in `.env` can be read from a `_config.yml`
- read project descriptions etc. from `markdown` files somewhere and render accordingly


# feature wishlist
- display existing files and allow user to delete
- allow multiple upload fields with different meta data that'll be associated
